# 1. Overview and Objectives

## 1.1 Purpose

The .NET Codebase Context MCP Server is intended to bridge **private .NET codebases** to AI assistants via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. This allows AI models to query, read, and interpret .NET source code and related project files *on demand*—thereby providing more accurate, context-aware coding help to developers. 

### Core Deliverables
1. **Context Server** (executable) that runs locally and exposes file/system-level “tools” to an AI via MCP.
2. **NuGet Library** that allows direct embedding or extension of the server in other .NET 9 applications.  
3. **CLI Tool (Global Tool)** for a frictionless “install and run” experience.

## 1.2 Goals

- **Contextual AI Assistance**: Provide real-time access to .NET source files, project metadata, and documentation so AI can answer project-specific queries.
- **Standards-Based**: Implement MCP “tools” in line with the official specification to ensure compatibility with any MCP-compliant AI client (e.g., Anthropic’s Claude Desktop, future GPT-based MCP clients, etc.).
- **Security**: Only expose read-only context by default, ensuring safe access patterns for proprietary code. Provide extension points for advanced scenarios (e.g., DevOps or write access).
- **Developer-Friendly**: Package the server as a .NET 9 console application and a NuGet library with minimal setup friction.  

## 1.3 Scope

The **MVP** focuses on read-only, codebase-oriented functionality:
- Listing projects & files within a solution.
- Searching or retrieving specific .cs files or project metadata.
- (Optionally) retrieving XML docs or Roslyn-based symbol info.
  
Subsequent versions might expand to DevOps data, advanced indexing, or specialized tooling. The design below accommodates these future expansions but keeps the initial deliverable lean and implementable in ~4 weeks.

```

1. **AI Client** (MCP-compatible) communicates with the **MCP Server**.  
2. The **MCP Server** receives requests, invokes the appropriate “tool” (e.g., `OpenFile`, `FindSymbol`, etc.), reads from the local .NET project, and returns the data to the AI client.  

## 2.2 Technology Stack

- **.NET 9**: Target the latest .NET runtime for continued support and access to new language/runtime features.
- **MCP .NET SDK**: A library such as [MCPSharp] or any new official MCP .NET package to handle protocol-level operations (JSON parsing, function registration, request routing).
- **Roslyn** (optional in MVP): For advanced symbol indexing, though a simpler file-based approach may be enough initially.
- **CLI / Global Tool**: Distributed via NuGet `dotnet tool` for easy installation.

---

# 3. Detailed Components

## 3.1 Project Scanner / Indexer

**Responsibility**: Parse the .NET solution folder to identify:
- All `.csproj` files (i.e., projects in the solution).
- All `.cs` files in each project.
- Basic project metadata (assembly name, references, etc.).
- (Optional) Generate an internal dictionary mapping symbols (class names, method names) to file paths for search.

**Implementation Considerations**:
- *For the MVP*: A simple directory traversal (`Directory.EnumerateFiles`) plus some naive pattern-matching to map class names to file paths might suffice.
- *Advanced Approach (Roslyn)*: Load each project in the solution using Roslyn’s `MSBuildWorkspace` to get full syntactic and semantic info. This allows robust “symbol search” (location of classes, methods, references). However, it increases complexity.

### Data Structures

- **ProjectIndex**:  
  ```csharp
  public class ProjectIndex
  {
      public List<string> ProjectPaths { get; set; } = new();
      public Dictionary<string, List<string>> FileIndexByProject { get; set; } = new();
      // Possibly a symbol->File path map
  }
  ```

- **SymbolMap** (optional advanced):
  ```csharp
  public class SymbolMap
  {
      public Dictionary<string, string> ClassToFile { get; set; } = new(); 
      // key: "Namespace.MyClass", value: "/path/to/MyClass.cs"
  }
  ```

## 3.2 MCP Tools

At the heart of the server are the “tools” or “functions” that the AI can call. Below are proposed minimal tools for the MVP:

1. **ListProjects**  
   - **Input**: None  
   - **Output**: Array/list of project filenames found in the solution.  
   - **Implementation**: Return all `.csproj` or `.vbproj` discovered.  

2. **ListFiles**  
   - **Input**: Project filename or ID  
   - **Output**: All `.cs` (and optionally `.resx`, `.config`) files in that project.  
   - **Implementation**: Return the relative paths from that project folder.  

3. **OpenFile**  
   - **Input**: File path (string)  
   - **Output**: File contents (string)  
   - **Implementation**: Read the file from disk as text. Optionally limit max file size or lines to avoid excessive response payload.  

4. **SearchCode**  
   - **Input**: A search keyword (string)  
   - **Output**: A list of file paths + line numbers where the keyword is found.  
   - **Implementation**: Naive approach: for each `.cs` file, do a substring search. Return lines with matches.  

5. **GetDocForSymbol** (Advanced)  
   - **Input**: Symbol name (e.g. “OrderService”)  
   - **Output**: The symbol’s code summary doc (if any) plus location.  
   - **Implementation**: If using Roslyn, retrieve XML doc comments. If not, fallback to searching for `///` doc comments near the symbol.  

**Example**: Using a .NET MCP library that supports attributes:

```csharp
using MCPSharp;  // Hypothetical or community MCP library

[McpTool("ListProjects")]
public List<string> ListProjects()
{
    return _projectIndex.ProjectPaths;
}

[McpTool("OpenFile")]
public string OpenFile(string filePath)
{
    if (!File.Exists(filePath)) 
        throw new FileNotFoundException("File not found", filePath);
    
    // Optional: limit length to avoid huge responses
    var content = File.ReadAllText(filePath);
    return content.Length > 100_000 
        ? content.Substring(0, 100_000) + "\n... [Truncated]" 
        : content;
}

// ... other tools ...
```

## 3.3 Server Host

**Responsibility**: The actual “server” that:
- Initializes the project index.
- Registers the tools (via reflection or attribute scanning).
- Binds to either STDIO or a local port for WebSocket/HTTP-based MCP connections.
- Manages the request/response loop, calling appropriate tool methods.

In many MCP .NET libraries, you’ll do something like:

```csharp
public class DotNetMcpServer
{
    private readonly ProjectIndex _projectIndex;

    public DotNetMcpServer(string solutionPath)
    {
        // Build index:
        _projectIndex = ProjectIndexer.BuildIndex(solutionPath);
    }

    public void Start()
    {
        var server = new McpServer();

        // Register tool classes/methods that have [McpTool] attributes:
        server.RegisterToolsFrom(this);

        // Or explicitly:
        server.RegisterTool("ListProjects", ListProjects);
        server.RegisterTool("OpenFile", OpenFile);
        // ...

        // Start listening (could be stdio or a TCP/Websocket port):
        server.RunStdio();
    }
}
```

## 3.4 CLI / Global Tool

### 3.4.1 Goals
- Simple installation: `dotnet tool install --global NetContextServer`
- Simple usage: `net-context-server --solution "path/to/MySolution.sln"`

### 3.4.2 Structure

When the user runs the tool:
1. Parse CLI arguments for solution path.
2. Create a `DotNetMcpServer` instance and call `.Start()`.
3. Output a message to the console indicating that the server is running and ready for MCP client connections (or has attached to stdio).
4. Handle `CTRL+C` or graceful shutdown.

```csharp
internal class Program
{
    private static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var solutionPath = ParseArgs(args);  // e.g. --solution "xyz.sln"
        var server = new DotNetMcpServer(solutionPath);
        
        Console.WriteLine($"Starting .NET Context MCP Server for solution: {solutionPath}");
        
        server.Start();  // Blocks, handling requests via stdio or WebSockets

        Console.WriteLine("Shutting down .NET Context MCP Server.");
    }
}
```

# 4. Data Flow and Use Scenarios

1. **User Query**: Developer asks an AI assistant: “Where is the user authentication code implemented in my solution?”
2. **AI to Server**: The AI, using MCP, invokes the `SearchCode` tool with a keyword like “Authenticate” or “AuthService”.
3. **Server Action**: The server scans the code files, returns matching lines and file paths.
4. **AI Response**: The AI processes the returned code snippet paths and can follow-up with `OpenFile("Services/AuthService.cs")` to get the full contents. 
5. **Result**: The AI crafts an answer referencing actual code from `AuthService.cs`. This is displayed to the developer.

---

# 5. Security and Access Control

## 5.1 Default Read-Only Access

- **Default Approach**: Tools only read code/files. No write or execute actions to avoid inadvertently letting the AI make destructive changes.
- **Opt-In Tools**: If an organization wants advanced features (e.g., “RefactorFile”), they can create those tools explicitly.

## 5.2 Sensitive Data Control

- **File Inclusion/Exclusion**: By default, ignore certain sensitive files (e.g., `.env`, `appsettings.Production.json`). The user can override if they wish.
- **Directory Whitelisting**: Only serve files under a known project root or `*.cs`, `*.csproj`. The developer can specify additional patterns or subfolders.

## 5.3 Logging / Auditing

- A production-ready environment may log all requests/responses to an internal file or a monitoring system.  
- For the MVP, at least a basic console log (tool name, parameters, timestamp) is recommended to help devs see what the AI is requesting.

# 6. Implementation Roadmap

Below is a suggested 4-week roadmap for a single indie developer:

| **Week** | **Tasks**                                                                                         |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**    | - Finalize project structure (MVP scope).<br/>- Select or set up the .NET 9 environment.<br/>- Explore and choose an MCP .NET library (e.g., MCPSharp).<br/>- Implement skeleton CLI (global tool). |
| **2**    | - Build **Project Indexer** (scan `.sln`, gather `.csproj`, `.cs`).<br/>- Implement initial MCP tools (`ListProjects`, `ListFiles`, `OpenFile`).<br/>- Set up basic server scaffolding, test local requests. |
| **3**    | - Implement advanced or optional tools (`SearchCode`, `GetDocForSymbol`).<br/>- Integrate logging, handle file size limits.<br/>- Write unit tests & basic integration tests. |
| **4**    | - Polish CLI (help screen, error messages).<br/>- Improve security defaults (ignore secrets).<br/>- Prepare documentation, README, usage demos.<br/>- Release `v1.0.0` as a NuGet tool + open-source repo. |

**Post-MVP**:
- Roslyn-based symbol indexing for robust searching.
- Optionally add WebSocket/HTTP server mode for remote usage.
- Create a small demo extension for VSCode or Visual Studio to auto-launch the server.

# 7. Testing and Quality Assurance

### 7.1 Unit Tests
- **Indexer Tests**: Ensure that scanning a sample solution yields the correct set of projects, files, etc.
- **Tool Method Tests**: `OpenFile` returns correct content, handles missing files gracefully, etc.

### 7.2 Integration Tests
- **MCP-level Tests**: Using a mock or minimal AI client to send JSON requests and verify correct JSON responses from the server.  
- **Cross-Platform Tests**: Validate on Windows, Linux, and macOS to confirm cross-OS path handling.

### 7.3 Performance Checks
- For large solutions, measure indexing time and memory usage. Implement streaming or chunked responses for large files if necessary.

---

# 8. Extension and Future Enhancements

1. **DevOps Integration**: Tools to retrieve build pipeline statuses from Azure DevOps, or read logs from a CI server.  
2. **Write/Refactor Tools**: Controlled environment for applying code changes (like a “pull request bot”).  
3. **Semantic Search / Vector Indexing**: Build a semantic index (e.g., using a local vector DB like Qdrant or Pinecone) for deeper “meaning-based” code queries, not just text matches.  
4. **IDE Integration**: A dedicated extension for VS/VSCode to automatically start/stop the server and let the AI know the code is available.

---

# 9. Distribution and Usage

## 9.1 NuGet Packaging

- **Main Library**: `NetContextServer.Core` – Contains the scanning, tooling, and server logic.  
- **CLI Tool**: `NetContextServer.Tool` – `dotnet tool` packaging referencing `NetContextServer.Core`.  
  - Installation: `dotnet tool install --global NetContextServer.Tool`
  - Usage: `net-context-server --solution "MySolution.sln"`

## 9.2 Open-Source Approach

- Host the source on GitHub (MIT or Apache 2.0 license).
- Provide a comprehensive README with:
  - Quick installation steps
  - “Hello World” usage example
  - Link to full docs (or Wiki) explaining advanced config.

---

# 10. Deployment and Promotion Considerations

- **Local Deployment**: Typically, developers run the server locally on their machines. No special infrastructure is needed besides the `.NET 9` runtime.  
- **Remote Deployment** (optional): Some teams might place the server behind a VPN or an internal server, letting remote developers or AI clients access code from a central machine. This would require enabling a network-based transport and additional authentication.  
- **Promotion**: 
  - Post an announcement on `.NET` community forums (e.g. Reddit `r/dotnet`, dev.to).  
  - Contribute to “awesome MCP servers” lists or Anthropic’s open-source repos.  
  - Demo usage in a short YouTube / blog tutorial to show real use-cases with an AI assistant.  

---

# 11. Monetization Strategy

1. **Open-Source Core**: Provide the basic read-only context server for free, encouraging widespread adoption.  
2. **Paid Extensions**: Consider commercial add-ons (e.g., secure web dashboard, advanced indexing, enterprise features).  
3. **Consulting & Support**: Offer premium support or specialized integration for enterprise clients (e.g., hooking into private Azure DevOps or custom frameworks).  
4. **Donations / Sponsorship**: Encourage GitHub Sponsors or corporate sponsorship if the tool becomes critical in many dev workflows.

---

# 12. Conclusion

By leveraging **.NET 9**, existing **MCP** libraries, and straightforward file-based indexing, an indie developer can implement a **.NET Codebase Context MCP Server** in ~3–4 weeks. This server will let AI assistants “see” real .NET code, bridging the gap between large language models’ generic knowledge and a developer’s specific codebase. The result is more relevant AI suggestions, improved Q&A for code navigation, and reduced “hallucinations.”

**Key Takeaways**:
- Keep it **simple** for the MVP: read-only file tools, minimal indexing.  
- Use a well-maintained **MCP .NET SDK** to avoid custom protocol handling.  
- Provide both a **NuGet library** and a **CLI tool** for broad usage scenarios.  
- Plan for **security** from day one—limit access to authorized directories and ignore sensitive config by default.  
- Grow the project **organically**, encouraging community contributions and integrating advanced features (Roslyn, DevOps, semantic search) as the user base expands.

By following this design, you set a solid foundation for a widely adopted solution that solves a key pain point for .NET developers eager to harness AI’s power with real project context.

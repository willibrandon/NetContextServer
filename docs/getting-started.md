# Getting Started with NetContextServer

Welcome to NetContextServer! This guide will help you get up and running in just a few minutes. NetContextServer is a powerful tool that enhances AI coding assistants by giving them deep understanding of your .NET codebase.

## Why NetContextServer?

When you're using AI coding assistants like Cursor AI or Claude, they work best when they understand your codebase. NetContextServer bridges this gap by:
- üîç Enabling AI to search and understand your code semantically
- üìÅ Providing secure access to your project structure and files
- üõ°Ô∏è Maintaining security with built-in safeguards for sensitive data
- üöÄ Making AI suggestions more relevant to your specific project

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9.0 or later
- For semantic search: Azure OpenAI account (optional but recommended)
- Git

### 1. Install NetContextServer

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/willibrandon/NetContextServer.git
cd NetContextServer

# Build the solution
dotnet build
```

### 2. Set Up Environment (for Semantic Search)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_azure_openai_endpoint
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_key
```

> üí° **Note**: NetContextServer works without Azure OpenAI, but semantic search will be disabled.

### 3. Test the Installation

```bash
# Run a simple hello test
dotnet run --project src/NetContextClient/NetContextClient.csproj -- hello

# Set your project directory
dotnet run --project src/NetContextClient/NetContextClient.csproj -- set-base-dir --directory "path/to/your/project"

# Try a semantic search
dotnet run --project src/NetContextClient/NetContextClient.csproj -- semantic-search --query "find authentication logic"
```

## Integration with Cursor AI

Cursor AI is one of the primary ways to use NetContextServer. Here's how to set it up:

1. Open Cursor AI
2. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command palette
3. Type "Configure MCP Server" and select it
4. Enter the following configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "command": "dotnet",
     "args": ["run", "--project", "path/to/NetContextServer/src/NetContextServer/NetContextServer.csproj"]
   }
   ```
5. Start coding! Try asking Cursor AI questions about your codebase.

Example prompts to try:
- "List all .NET source files in this project directory"
- "Search for exact text matches in the code files"
- "Analyze NuGet packages in all projects"
- "Get the current list of ignore patterns"
- "Add these ignore patterns: *.generated.cs, bin/*"
- "List all .csproj files in this directory"
- "Show me the contents of this file"
- "What's the current base directory for file operations?"

## Common Operations

### Project Navigation
```bash
# List all projects in a directory
dotnet run --project src/NetContextClient/NetContextClient.csproj -- list-projects-in-dir --directory "path/to/dir"

# List source files in a project
dotnet run --project src/NetContextClient/NetContextClient.csproj -- list-source-files --project-dir "path/to/project"
```

### Code Search
```bash
# Text-based search
dotnet run --project src/NetContextClient/NetContextClient.csproj -- search-code --text "authentication"

# Semantic search (requires Azure OpenAI)
dotnet run --project src/NetContextClient/NetContextClient.csproj -- semantic-search --query "how is user data validated"
```

### Package Analysis
```bash
# First set your base directory
dotnet run --project src/NetContextClient/NetContextClient.csproj -- set-base-dir --directory "path/to/your/project"

# Analyze packages across all projects
dotnet run --project src/NetContextClient/NetContextClient.csproj -- analyze-packages
```

The package analysis provides:
- Visualization of transitive dependencies with color-coded graphs
- Detection of unused packages (‚ö†Ô∏è) and available updates (üîÑ)
- Security vulnerability warnings (üî¥)
- Smart grouping of related packages by namespace
- Recommendations for package maintenance

### Security Management
```bash
# Add files to ignore
dotnet run --project src/NetContextClient/NetContextClient.csproj -- add-ignore-patterns --patterns "*.secret" "*.key"

# View current ignore patterns
dotnet run --project src/NetContextClient/NetContextClient.csproj -- get-ignore-patterns
```

## Using Coverage Analysis

NetContextServer includes powerful test coverage analysis capabilities that help you understand and improve your test coverage. Here's how to get started:

### 1. Generate Coverage Reports

First, you'll need to generate a coverage report. NetContextServer supports multiple formats:

**Using Coverlet (recommended):**
```bash
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```
This will generate a coverage report in the `TestResults` directory.

**Using LCOV:**
If you're using LCOV, make sure your test runner is configured to output LCOV format (`.info` files).

**Using Cobertura:**
For Cobertura XML format, configure your test runner to output `.cobertura.xml` files.

### 2. Analyze Coverage

Once you have a coverage report, you can analyze it using NetContextServer:

```bash
# Analyze coverage for detailed per-file information
dotnet run --project src/NetContextClient/NetContextClient.csproj -- coverage-analysis --report-path "TestResults/coverage.json"

# Get a summary of overall coverage
dotnet run --project src/NetContextClient/NetContextClient.csproj -- coverage-summary --report-path "TestResults/coverage.json"
```

### 3. Interpret Results

The coverage analysis provides several key insights:

- **Coverage Percentage**: The percentage of lines covered by tests
- **Uncovered Lines**: Specific line numbers that aren't covered by tests
- **Branch Coverage**: For methods with conditional logic, shows how many branches are covered
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for improving coverage in specific areas

### 4. Improve Coverage

Use the analysis results to:
1. Identify files with low coverage
2. Focus on uncovered lines in critical code paths
3. Add tests for uncovered branches in complex methods
4. Track coverage trends over time

For more details on coverage analysis commands and options, see the [Tool Reference](tool-reference.md#coverage-analysis-tools).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Directory not found" error**
   - Ensure the path exists and is accessible
   - Use absolute paths if relative paths aren't working

2. **Semantic search not working**
   - Check your Azure OpenAI environment variables
   - Verify your Azure OpenAI service is running
   - Ensure you have embedding model access

3. **Access denied errors**
   - Verify the file/directory is within your set base directory
   - Check file permissions
   - Review ignore patterns that might be blocking access

### Getting Help

- Check out our [contribution guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to help improve NetContextServer

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Set a Specific Base Directory**
   - Always set the base directory to your project root
   - This ensures AI tools have access to all relevant files

2. **Use Semantic Search Effectively**
   - Write natural language queries
   - Be specific about what you're looking for
   - Use domain terminology from your codebase

3. **Manage Ignore Patterns**
   - Add patterns for generated files to reduce noise
   - Don't forget to ignore sensitive files
   - Review patterns periodically

4. **Keep the Server Running**
   - Start NetContextServer before beginning your coding session
   - It will maintain an index of your code for faster searches

# Project Indexer Implementation Rules

This rule provides guidance for implementing the Project Scanner/Indexer component of the .NET Codebase Context Server.

## Core Functionality
- Implement efficient solution and project file scanning
- Create a robust file indexing mechanism
- Build a simple symbol mapping system using file-based approach
- Ensure proper handling of large codebases

## Implementation Approach
- Use simple directory traversal for the MVP
- Implement caching to avoid redundant file operations
- Consider async file operations for better performance
- Provide clear progress reporting for large solutions

## Data Structures
- Design clean, immutable data structures for project metadata
- Implement efficient lookup mechanisms for files and symbols
- Use appropriate collection types for different access patterns
- Consider memory usage when dealing with large codebases

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling for file system operations
- Gracefully handle missing or invalid project files
- Provide meaningful error messages for troubleshooting
- Log all indexing operations for debugging purposes

## Security
- Validate all file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Implement proper access control for sensitive files
- Consider resource limits for large codebases
- Never execute code from the codebase being analyzed
